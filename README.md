# ProjectEuler
My work on the Project Euler problems

SPOILER ALERT: if you haven't solved these problems, you're ruining the fun of
               solving them yourself.

I'm using this repo just to store my own work and learn some features of Python
that I haven't used much. Only my own changes will be accepted into this repo.
